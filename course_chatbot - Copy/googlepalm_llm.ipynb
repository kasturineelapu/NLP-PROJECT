How to solve this?\\nresponse: Hi, please check these instructions.\\n\\nOption - 1:\\nIf you are from India, you can change your system default date format to India, then restart your computer once. and see, whether it fixed your issue or not. Else you can follow the second option.\\n\\nOption - 2:\\n\\n1. Reason for the Issue:\\nIn the dim_date table, the date is in dd/mm/yyyy format. Whereas the fact table is in mm/dd/yyyy format. Because of the different formats, causing the issue. Power BI/Excel will likely use your system\\'s default date format whenever you open any file. This could cause the date format issue - dd/mm/yyyy --- mm/dd/yyyy. Please look for this whenever you face issues with values mismatch.\\n\\n2. Steps to resolve:\\n    1. Change the data type of the date column to ‘Date’ if it is in ‘Date/Time’ format. Skip this step if it is already in ‘Date’ format.\\n    2. Create a new custom column in the fact_sales_monthly table. you can name it date_modified or any other name accordingly.\\n    Formula\\n    = Date.ToText([date],\"yyyy\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Day([date])),2,\"0\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Month([date])),2,\"0\")\\n    3. change the data type of the above-created column to date.\\n    4. In Power Pivot, Go to the \\'Manage\\' tab and select the \\'Diagram\\' view. Map the date column in the \\'dim_date\\' table with the newly created column in the \\'fact_sales_monthly\\' table.
